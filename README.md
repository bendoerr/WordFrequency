### What is this?

This is the [Haddock](www.haskell.org/haddock/) documentation for the Word Frequency Histogram that I wrote in Haskell.

### This is just source!

And it can be viewed in all it's rendered glory over there -> http://bendoerr.github.com/WordFrequency/.

### What is this documenting?

It is documenting some code in the same [repository](https://github.com/bendoerr/WordFrequency/tree/gh-pages) you are looking at but just over on the [master](https://github.com/bendoerr/WordFrequency/tree/master) branch.

### How did you get the source links back to Github?

I made use of [Haddock's](www.haskell.org/haddock/) `--source-base=URL, --source-module=URL, and --source-entity=URL` options. I a [script](https://github.com/bendoerr/WordFrequency/blob/master/gh-pages.sh) since there is a lot to type.
